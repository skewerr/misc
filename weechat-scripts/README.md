# weechat-scripts

There's really only one script right now, so I'm not going to separate it by
language in the repo. I wanted to make at least one weechat script just to see
if it'd work. It's how I learned Python(making scripts for hexchat), so why not?

# misc\_stuff.py

These are just functions I use for my own amusement or whatever.
