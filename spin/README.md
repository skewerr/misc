A space invaders clone(if you could call it one) I'm trying to make with
[Allegro](http://allegro.cc/).

I suck at programming, so this will likely have to change many times as I work
on it. At the end it'll probably have very shitty code, but hey, I'm still
getting used to Allegro. Please be gentle.

I was going to use this to encourage some friends who want to learn C, but after
reading the documentation for Allegro, I realized it isn't really tailored to
novice programmers(you should at least know what pointers are and all). Still,
maybe I can learn a thing or two by using the library.
