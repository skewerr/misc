# weechat-plugins

There's really only one plugin right now, so I'm not going to separate it by
language in the repo. I wanted to make at least one weechat plugin just to see
if it'd work. It's how I learned Python(making scripts for hexchat), so why not?

# misc (C)

These are just functions I use for my own amusement, to complement my setup, or
whatever.
